# HEALTHCARE-FRAUD-DETECTION.ipynb
## Introduction
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques in detecting fraudulent activities within the healthcare industry. By leveraging supervised learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the study aims to identify patterns indicative of fraud in medical billing data. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on healthcare providers, medical claims, and billing transactions. A key aspect of this study is addressing data imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve model performance. The full dataset can be accessed via the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamilsel/healthcare-providers-data.

## Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, and all relevant scripts, datasets, and model outputs are organized within this repository. The main file, Healthcare_Fraud_Detection.ipynb, contains the complete workflow, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation. The repository also includes a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies required to run the project. To install the necessary libraries, users can execute the command:

## Results
The results of this study demonstrate that Neural Networks outperform other models, achieving an accuracy of 99.68% in detecting fraudulent claims. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting also show strong performance, while traditional models like Logistic Regression and SVM exhibit lower accuracy. This highlights the importance of deep learning in fraud detection, particularly for recognizing complex fraud patterns. The findings suggest that integrating real-time adaptive learning could further enhance fraud detection efficiency by allowing models to adjust dynamically to evolving fraudulent behaviors.

## Future Work
Future work in this area could explore the use of Explainable AI (XAI) to improve model interpretability, ensuring that predictions are transparent and understandable for healthcare professionals. Additionally, federated learning techniques could be integrated to enhance data privacy by enabling collaborative fraud detection across multiple healthcare institutions without compromising sensitive patient information.
